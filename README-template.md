## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<p class="payment-plan">
  <span
    ><img
      class="music-icon"
      src="/order-summary-component-main/images/icon-music.svg"
      alt="music icon"
  /></span>
  <span><span class="bold">Annual Plan</span> $59.99/year</span>
  <span class="change-payment"><a href="/change">Change</a></span>
</p>
```

```css

```

```js

```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I still want to go through for loops and forEach methods since they seem to be used for different things.
